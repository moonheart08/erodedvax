== Architectural subsets ==
See page 373 of the VAX design manual for architectural subsets.
The following subsets *must* be implemented for this to be considered a working emulator:
    Kernel (For the most part. Can temporarily skip the OS instructions for simplicity's sake)
    F_floating (maps to x86-64 32-bit floats)
    G_floating (maps to x86-64 64-bit floats)
    The following instructions:
    `MOVTC`  
    `MOVTUC`
    `CMPC3`
    `CMPC5`
    `SCANC`
    `SPANC`
    `LOCC`
    `SKPC`
    `MATCHC`
